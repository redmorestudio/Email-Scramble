## Integration Guide

### WordPress Integration

Add this component to your WordPress site using either a shortcode or direct iframe embedding.

#### Using Shortcode

Add this to your theme's `functions.php` or a site-specific plugin:

```php
function email_protector_shortcode() {
    return '<iframe 
        src="https://email-scramble.onrender.com" 
        width="100%" 
        height="200" 
        frameborder="0" 
        scrolling="no"
        style="overflow:hidden; max-width: 500px; margin: 0 auto; display: block;"
    ></iframe>';
}
add_shortcode('email_protector', 'email_protector_shortcode');
```

Then use it in any post or page with:
```
[email_protector]
```

#### Direct HTML Integration

Add this HTML where you want the email protection to appear:

```html
<iframe 
    src="https://email-scramble.onrender.com" 
    width="100%" 
    height="200" 
    frameborder="0"
